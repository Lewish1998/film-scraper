# Quick website scrapper
Scraping some different cinemas so I don't have to browse through them.
Currently using Flask to create a webpage but might just email myself once a day. Undecided.. 
Still some more to do and then some (lots) refactoring.

Json Data example:
```  
{
    "location": "Cineworld - Parkhead",
    "title": "Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes",
    "showtimes": [
      "13:15",
      "16:30",
      "19:50"
    ]
  }
```
